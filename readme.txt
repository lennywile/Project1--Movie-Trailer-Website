Project 1 – Movie Trailer Website

This is a 3 file solution that upon execution, opens a web browser, displaying a set of movies.  When the user clicks on one of the movies, the movie’s trailer is played.

Files

media.py – class definition for the Movie class
mymovies.py – the instantiation of the Movie class with six classic movies
fresh_tomatoes.py – the instructor provided rendering code for the web page

How to Run the Code

1. Copy the 3 files (media.py, mymovies.py, fresh_tomatoes.py) into a folder (all in the same folder).
2. Load mymovies.py into your favorite IDE  (either Sublime 2 or IDLE) – (file / open)
3. Run the mymovies.py file from your favorite IDE (F7 from within Sublime 2, or F5 from within IDLE).
4. This will launch the Fresh Tomatoes Movies Trailers web page. From this page, click on any of the great movies listed to see their       trailer.  
5. Close the web page when you are finished.
